To utilize the Food Knowledge Graph for Personalized Dietary Recommendations:


1. **Import ProKnow Class**: Import the necessary class for utilizing the Food Knowledge Graph:

    ```python
    from PKiL import ProKnow
    ```

2. **Create Instance**: Instantiate the `ProKnow` class:

    ```python
    pk1 = ProKnow()
    ```

3. **Load Data**: Load the data into the system by processing and constructing the Food Knowledge Graph. Use files containing information such as nutritional content, dietary restrictions, and food categorization. 

    ```python
    pk1.load_food_knowledge('data/Ing_Sub_1_2_3_7_NoDup_Labeling.json', 'data/dietary_restrictions.csv')
    ```

    Ensure that the provided files contain relevant information and are properly formatted.

4. **Provide User Input**: Define the dietary preferences or health conditions for which personalized recommendations are required:

    ```python
    user_input = "Can I eat kimchi fried rice"
    
    ```

5. **Generate Recommendations**: Utilize the trained model to generate personalized dietary recommendations based on the user input:

    ```python
    recommendations = pk1.evaluate_pk(user_input,explanation=True)
    ```

  
By following these steps, you'll be able to leverage the Food Knowledge Graph to provide personalized dietary recommendations tailored to individual dietary preferences and health conditions.
