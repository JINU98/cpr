-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at /r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the "depression" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See /r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- "I'm here to help" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The "giving help" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. "achievement" or "advice" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that "internet culture" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The "what is depression" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.<br><br><td style="color: white;"></td><p> <br> <a href="#" target="_blank" class="button fit"><i class="fa fa-comments" aria-hidden="true"></i> Comments</a> </p> <hr class="major"> </span></div><div style="margin: 0px auto; width: 100%;"><span> Posted by : <strong> u/SQLwitch</strong> &nbsp;<span> </span> </span> <span>   </span><div style="display: flex; gap: 10px;"><div><h3>Our most-broken and least-understood rules is "helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort", so we've made a new wiki to explain it </h3></div><div><p style="background-color: grey; color: white; margin: 1px; padding: 5px; font-size: 12px; border-radius: 10px;"></p></div><div><p style="background-color: rgb(245, 106, 106); color: white; margin: 1px; padding: 5px; font-size: 12px; border-radius: 10px;">None</p></div></div><div><source width="640" height="480" frameborder="0"></div><span> We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say "PM me anytime" in a casual social context.

We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


"PM me anytime" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say "PM me" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.<br><br><td style="color: white;"> </td><p> <br> <a href="#" target="_blank" class="button fit"><i class="fa fa-comments" aria-hidden="true"></i> Comments</a> </p> <hr class="major"> </span></div><div style="margin: 0px auto; width: 100%;"><span> Posted by : <strong> u/ChewyBoiy</strong> &nbsp;<span> </span> </span> <span>   </span><div style="display: flex; gap: 10px;"><div><h3>Why do depressed people stop contacting people they care about without realizing it? </h3></div><div><p style="background-color: grey; color: white; margin: 1px; padding: 5px; font-size: 12px; border-radius: 10px;"></p></div><div><p style="background-color: rgb(245, 106, 106); color: white; margin: 1px; padding: 5px; font-size: 12px; border-radius: 10px;">Behavourial or attempt</p></div></div><div><source width="640" height="480" frameborder="0"></div><span> I never understood this.

I’ve fought major depression for so long and through so much.

I got sober, went back on medication, left a bad relationship, got a cat, went back to therapy, met an amazing partner, got promoted at work, and I just… crashed.

I dread waking up. I put off getting up as long as I can because it’s physically painful to lift myself out of bed.

I feed the cat, take the meds I’m prescribed, put on whatever pants and sweater are closest, and go to work.

Work is okay. I like my coworkers. The work itself is alright. It’s a distraction. I feel so overwhelmed by exhaustion all throughout the day, to the extent that it becomes difficult to keep my eyes open.

I get home, feed the cat, and go straight to bed. I struggle to even make myself food or shower. I used to dedicate time to preparing myself meals, exercising, even being creative or seeing my friends, but all of that is just more than I can handle now.

I lie here and so desperately want to do more or be more. I wanted to be a musician, I wanted to be creative and put something out into the world that moved people. I can’t even stay motivated enough to sing anymore or practice my instruments, and here I thought I could tour with my band and grow some actual following.

If not that, I just want to know who I am or who I can be. I want to feel like something I do matters. Yet, I’m too tired to do anything. I’m so exhausted all the time. I want to make improvements and try to figure out how to be happy, but I’m so tired. I don’t want to be tired anymore.<br><br><td style="color: white;"> <span style="background-color:#A00">"Yep that’s me</span>

However, I looked back at an old diary and I found an entry that still emotionally sits with me to this day. The idea was not really of dying but escaping to somewhere where I believe I would be happier and have better experiences. I used to be religious for context but I used to pray to maybe die and reincarnate in a world that's like one of my favorite shows at the time. The idea that being in a world of death but true and honest people was better than my current reality.   
I found myself laying in bed for hours just... daydreaming? making up scenarios and getting lost in them but I'm still awake. It kinda affected my daily functions at this point and I'm not really sure what to do at this point. It's like I know this isn't really the best option to cope but there really isn't much else. I get stressed or upset and my brain just kinda ... takes over putting a blindfold over my eyes.  
I'm sorry if this isn't really for r/depression, I am just kinda curious if anyone else experiences this because I'm not even too sure if it counts as me wanting to die.<br><br><td style="color: white;"> <span style="background-color:#A00">"Just so I feel like I’m still needed here</span>

I’m 48 and have suffered from dysthymia (long-term) depression for several decades now. My depression arose initially from a social anxiety problem that caused me to basically withdraw from and hide from life starting in my late teens.

I also have been enduring a chronic pain condition due to my having two bad hips (a problem that arose during my teenage years but which has progressively gotten worse).

I feel very badly nowadays, and I don’t see a viable way for me to improve my situation either short-term or long-term, as I am very poor, do not work a regular job, and currently live with my mother and stepfather in So. Cal. 

Basically, since about age 17, I haven’t functioned very well because of the depression/anxiety problems. At the onset of those issues, I basically disengaged from normal life and have pretty much spent the subsequent decades running on fumes, doing just enough to get by but never excelling or being successful in any meaningful ways.

I’m embarrassed about my being so unsuccessful in life, and I’m doubly embarrassed about my having to live at home at my age. I feel like an abject failure, basically, and I feel as if I am losing my ability to cope with my depression. 

I’m seeing a therapist thru Telehealth via my Medi-Cal
coverage, and I have also talked to my primary doctor about my situation. But nothing much seems to help. Just talk therapy and a prescription for Zoloft.

I’m in both physical and psychological pain, and I really detest my daily life. Truthfully, my life up til now has not been that great overall — and that really pisses me off! 

However, I’m not sure what to do. I need some real help, but I’m not sure what that means. I often have the urge to drive myself to the emergency room or to simply call 911 on myself, especially at night when things are quiet and dark and I over-fixate on how bad my life is and how much I hate it. 

I very much feel trapped and almost suffocated by my current situation.

However, I’m not even sure what I am asking here or what this post is meant to accomplish — perhaps it is just a vent and nothing more.

But I feel as if I am reaching the point where I have to absolutely do something to really help myself or change my circumstances — because all that I am doing now is spinning my wheels.

I have no prospects. I have no college degree. I have a very limited social life. I don’t earn much income (all I can do now is gig work). I need hip replacement surgery. And to make it all worse, I can’t afford to live on my own (I stay in the same bedroom that I did growing up).

Daily life for me is very depressing.

I would seriously appreciate any and all feedback that anyone cares to offer. I’m open to suggestions and all feedback. 

Seriously, I’m a pretty miserable guy right now, and I hate myself for not being able to function better as an adult. I’ve really squandered myself in so many ways — and it hurts to realize that!<br><br><td style="color: white;"> <span style="background-color:#A00">"I felt different <span style="background-color:#0A0">my whole life <span style="background-color:#A50">I was diagnosed <span style="background-color:#00A">with bi <span style="background-color:#A0A">polar depression</span></span></span></span></span>

i had self-harmed previously in 2015, when i had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. i then stopped, then relapsed in 2017. i had a very bad relapse that year where i had felt as if another being had been controlling me when i first relapsed. i managed to stop, but i still managed to feel depressed every two years typically. 2020 was awful for me. i moved in a toxic family member, my mother had died and my depression was ramping up, then had gotten kicked out. i moved in with another family member (a sister whom i'm very close to) in 2021. she has two kids. i'd like to say i have very bad anger management issues that i struggle to get help with, and it's incredibly hard to manage.

anyway, i've been having a rough week for no particular reason besides my niece and nephew stressing me out. yesterday my niece threw a tantrum because i told her she wasn't allowed to go get her friend while i was babysitting (her mother said she wasn't allowed to) for like a half an hour. tbh the kids are rather manipulative towards me sometimes, and it becomes extremely stressful.

so today, my nephew had been playing on his stepfathers gaming system all day, and everything was great until his mom (my sister) had gone to work. him &amp;amp; his sister were taking turns on another game after his mom told him to get off the switch. i told them to just switch after one of them fails, but he got angry at me and yelled at me. he then told me he wa going to leave to go to his friends house after his mother had told him to wait until the stepfather got home. i repeated this to him in a nice tone, and he yelled at me again &amp;amp; called me names. he said he was going to go to his friends anyway, and call the police on me because i had said to take turns on the game. then he mentioned that he was going to his frends to get a shotgun (which he later laughed off and said was a nerf gun but i don't believe him) and hearing things like that is incredibly stressful for me. i had gotten angry at him, as he's been treating me horribly for about a month or so while i have been, for the most part, nice to him, and it had caused a mental break that i could feel coming on for the past week.

i had been sitting in the kitchen, and all the noises were bothering me a lot, so i attempted to cover my ears, but that didn't work and it caused me even more stress. in a fit, i had grabbed a knife from the chopping block and harmed myself several times. i haven't done that in 5 years and it just caused more anguish. i feel awful, i feel even worse for how i reacted by getting angry and harming myself in two different ways (i hit myself in the head often as a substitute, and i know that counts as self-harm but i consider these two different categories). i have no idea what to and just needed to speak this out into the world. if anyone actually reads all of this, thanks for caring. most people in my life probably wouldn't read all of this.<br><br><td style="color: white;"> <span style="background-color:#A00">"About once a month I feel this doom overwhelm me <span style="background-color:#A0A">and it makes me feel like I don’t deserve happiness</span></span>

I feel so worthless and like I don’t matter to anyone. I have some friends but I don’t feel that close to them, I would call them low maintenance friends, but I just feel like I can’t speak to them or that I have the energy to want to. I was going to the gym and trying to better myself but now I’ve just fallen into a deep depression and can’t seem to get out of it. I suffer from anxiety and depression but normally manage it quite well, I just can’t bring myself to do anything at all lately. I have laid in my bed all day, slept a lot and I’m just so sad and I feel like tomorrow will be the same. 😔 I see everyone else be happy and it is killing me inside, I just want to be like them.

My next psychology appointment is a month away, I tried antidepressants 2 weeks ago but had to stop after 1 week of taking them (with confirmation from my dr) as they were making me worse. I just don’t know what to do anymore.<br><br><td style="color: white;"> <span style="background-color:#A00">"I don’t know how to break it to them</span>

But there’s a part of me who knows I should be doing much more like the rest of my family. I just can’t and it kills me inside, which just makes it even harder. It’s like there’s two voices in my head, one saying do nothing, and one that’s says I’m destined for so much more.

I'm 25, trans masc and live in germany. 

Right now I'm not in job training, cause I kept struggling. My therapist had to go to the hospital early cause of her pregnancy and her temp replacement wont be avaible till january. 
And only in february I have an appointment at an ADHS doctor. But I still have my meds, so thats okay. 

One of my problems right now is that I'm lonely. Wish I had someone in my town to date or just go out together. But its not that easy to find queer people.

But the biggest thing is: I wake up normally and I just feel empty. I dont want to do anything, dont look forward to anything. I sit at my pc, play games that give me just a little dopamine and that's it. 
I would love to draw more but my executive dysfunction stops me. 
I miss being a little happy. Miss being me.<br><br><td style="color: white;"> <span style="background-color:#A00">"I’m 21 years old</span>

a real deal high. I’m truly unable to get out of bed and go to work.

I told my supervisor I needed to quit because I simply can’t do my job and she gave me 2 weeks of sick leave before quitting to see if I could work through this episode (I had a note from a psychiatrist describing my diagnosis). 

I told a ~kinda~ close co worker that I was on 2 weeks of sick leave for mental health issues when she asked if I wanted to go out for drinks last night. 

I’m now regretting sharing this information and questioning if this is common/acceptable or very unusual in the workplace. I know modern style bosses will allow “mental health days” every now and then but two weeks is a lot. 

Im feeling guilty and wondering if my coworkers are resenting me for this.<br><br><td style="color: white;"> </td><p> <br> <a href="#" target="_blank" class="button fit"><i class="fa fa-comments" aria-hidden="true"></i> Comments</a> </p> <hr class="major"> </span></div><div style="margin: 0px auto; width: 100%;"><span> Posted by : <strong> u/TheRealM3999</strong> &nbsp;<span> </span> </span> <span>   </span><div style="display: flex; gap: 10px;"><div><h3>My Honest Opinion </h3></div><div><p style="background-color: grey; color: white; margin: 1px; padding: 5px; font-size: 12px; border-radius: 10px;"></p></div><div><p style="background-color: rgb(245, 106, 106); color: white; margin: 1px; padding: 5px; font-size: 12px; border-radius: 10px;">None</p></div></div><div><source width="640" height="480" frameborder="0"></div><span> No one will ever be there for you, you're alone in this world no matter what people say, i know this from experience and how fucked up i am now, i dont want to be happy ever again, fuck that, im a loner by choice now and will commit at some point.
