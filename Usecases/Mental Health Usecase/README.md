To utilize the Suicidality Risk Assessment with CPR code:

1. Define the text data you want to assess for suicidality risk. This could be social media posts, text messages, or any other relevant text input.

2. Import the `ProKnow` class from the `PKiL` library:

```python
from PKiL import ProKnow
```

3. Create an instance of the `ProKnow` class:

```python
pk1 = ProKnow()
```

4. Load the C-SSRS causal process knowledge into the `ProKnow` instance by calling the `process_knowledge` method with the appropriate files:

```python
pk1.process_knowledge('cssrs.txt', 'cssrs_annotate.txt')
```

Ensure that `cssrs.txt` contains the relevant concepts/entities and `cssrs_annotate.txt` contains the causal relationships between these concepts as defined by the C-SSRS framework.

5. Provide the text data you want to assess for suicidality risk:

```python
test_point = "Your text data here"
```

6. Call the `evaluate_pk` method of the `ProKnow` instance with the input text and set `explanation=True` to receive an explanation for the predicted label based on the causal reasoning process:

```python
label = pk1.evaluate_pk(test_point, explanation=True)
```

Replace `"Your text data here"` with the text data you want to assess.

By following these steps, you'll be able to utilize the CPR-based approach for suicidality risk assessment and obtain explainable predictions based on the C-SSRS framework.
